Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies, understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.
-----
Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and uncover valuable insights from the dataset.

Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of 20K rows of data, representing Amazon sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers, products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
Analysis Questions Resolved
-------------------------------------
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data analysis techniques:

Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
Find out the average quantity ordered per category.
Identify the top 5 products that have generated the highest revenue.
Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the previous year. 
Identify the highest profitable sub-category.
Find out the states with the highest total orders.
Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales).
Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category.
Identify the top 2 categories that have received maximum returns and their return percentage.
